Solution overview
</h2>

This accelerator leverages Azure AI Foundry, Azure AI Content Understanding Service, Azure OpenAI Service, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Container Apps to transform large volumes of unstructured content through event-driven processing pipelines for integration into downstream applications and post-processing activities. Processing, extraction and data schema transformation steps are scored for accuracy to automate processing and identify as-needed human validation.

### Prerequisites and costs
To deploy this solution accelerator, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create **resource groups, resources, app registrations, and assign roles at the resource group level**. This should include Contributor role at the subscription level and Role Based Access Control role on the subscription and/or resource group level. Follow the steps in [Azure Account Set Up](./docs/AzureAccountSetup.md).

Here are some example regions where the services are available: East US, East US2, Australia East, UK South, France Central, Africa.

Check the [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=all&regions=all) page and select a **region** where the following services are available.

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage. The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers. However, Azure Container Registry has a fixed cost per registry per day.

Use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator) to calculate the cost of this solution in your subscription. [Review a sample pricing sheet for the achitecture](https://azure.com/e/0a9a1459d1a2440ca3fd274ed5b53397).

Business scenario
</h2>

<br/>

A data analyst at a property insurance company manages and ensures claims for data accuracy and compliance.

A recent natural disaster has led to an influx of insurance claims coming into the pipeline. The analyst is tasked with accurately validating ingested data from claims and invoices being processed through the system. Claims data includes various multi-modal content types, with details extracted and mapped to defined schemas such as policy plans, invoices, and insurance adjuster reports.

AI is used to extract, transform, and flag potential discrepancies, such as missing policyholder details and outlier repair estimates. The data analyst then cross-checks the findings against historical claims data and regulatory guidelines. Collaborating with the compliance team, she verifies the flagged issues and refines the dataset.

Thanks to AI pipeline processing, data moves much faster, more accurately, and is more seamlessly integrated into the data analyst's workflow.

⚠️ The sample data used in this repository is synthetic and generated using Azure OpenAI service. The data is intended for use as sample data only.

### Security guidelines

This template uses Azure Key Vault to store all connections to communicate between resources.

This template also uses [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for local development and deployment.

To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend that anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [Github secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

* Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud to [secure your Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/defender-for-cloud).
* Protecting the Azure Container Apps instance with a [firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) and/or [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli).
